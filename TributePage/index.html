        <h3>Elizabeth J. Phillips (Magie)</h3>
        <h5>(May 9, 1866 - March 2, 1948)</h5>
        <p>Like millions of people, you have probably heard about the game <span>Monopoly</span> but did you know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darrow">Charles Darrow </a> is not the creator? Let me introduce you to the true author.</p>
        <p>Lizzie was born in Macomb, Illinois. She was a feminist, poet, writer, stenographer, secretary (typist), comedian and engineer. Lizzie had very strong ideals and was not afraid to speak out her mind. Not your very typical girl for her time I would dare say. </p>
        <p>The game is not her only creation. At the age of 26 she received a patent for her invention that made the typewriting process easier by allowing paper to go through the rollers more easily.</p>
        <p>She married at 44, another aspect that shows how "unconventional" she was by not following the expected from a woman. She worked as stenographer making $10 (not enough to sustain herself). She recognize the inequality between men and women. How the conditions dictated by men where only to benefit themselves (white men) and publish an add on the newspaper to show her inconformity. Great activism on her part!. </p>

        <p>In <span>1903</span> Magie applied to the US Patent Office for a patent on her board game. <em>The Landlor's Game</em>  was granted US patent 748, 626 (Fg.1). </p>
        <p>On her gaem she developed two different set of rules. One where the whole purpose was to get rich, rich, rich (monopilist) no matter whom do you crush.  And the Other (anti-monopolist) where all were rewarded when wealth was created. All this with one purpose, to <span>educate</span> demostrating the economic ill effects of Monopolism. (Wish we had paid attention uh?)</p>
        
        <p>Lizzie tried to have her game manufactured at the Parker Brother's Company.  And of course, as a woman of her time, was rejected. Years later Mr. Darrow presented, with some "changes" of course, the same idea as his own! and surprise, surprise: it took off!.   </p>

        <p>There is a lot more to the story of Lizzie Magie, another great woman ignored becuase of the "men rules". Its about time some get recognition. </p>
